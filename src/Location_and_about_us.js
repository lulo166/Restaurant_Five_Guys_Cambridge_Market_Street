      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h4>We are the Five Guys in Cambrigde Market, one of the best burgers in Cambridge. At Five Guys, we want to make your in-store experience as great as possible. We love our customers! That’s why we try to be as generous as we can with your order. Our burgers come with two patties as standard (but you can get a little burger if you’re only feeling a bit peckish) and we put enough of your chosen toppings in your burger that you taste them with every bite, so if you’ve ordered pickles, we know that means you want more than just one!
        We love that we’re known for our fry portion sizes. If you’re not in the know, it’s because all our portions come with an extra scoop in the bag. Our founder, Jerry, says that if people aren’t complaining that there’s too many, there aren’t enough!
        We also throw in plenty of extras when you visit, like how you add your choice of 15 burger toppings and 11 milkshake mix-ins for free, so mix and match to your heart’s content! We have free peanuts whilst you wait for your order and there are unlimited free refills on our sodas using the Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine. It’s all to make your customer experience the best it can be! We want you to be able to personalise your order so it’s exactly what YOU want. Those 15 free burger toppings we just mentioned means there are over 250,000 burger combinations, so if you had a different burger every day, it would take you 684 years to try them all! For our milkshakes, the 11 free mix-ins means there’s over 1000 combinations and there are over 100 soda flavours on the Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine. (If you combine flavours like mixing Coke and Dr Pepper, there’s over 1,000,000!)
        We know that’s a lot of numbers to take in, so just trust us when we say you can customise your order so it’s exactly how you want it, but you better start soon! The quality of our food starts with our ingredients. The prime beef for our patties is 120-day grain fed in Scotland, meaning it has an 80:20 lean fat ratio so the patties get a lovely marbling effect and taste delicious.
        It doesn’t just end with our beef; all our burger toppings, potatoes, milkshake mix-ins and buns are the finest we can find. The buns are even a secret recipe only for Five Guys! Plus, our mayonnaise is our own recipe which our friends at Heinz kindly make for us (Thanks, Heinz). To top it off, everything you see in store is fresh and prepared by hand daily. We don’t even have freezers in our stores!</h4>
